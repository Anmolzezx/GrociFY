# 🛒 Grocify (Kotlin - Android Native)

Grocify is a grocery delivery app built using native Android (Kotlin).  
The app aims to provide users with a seamless experience to browse, order, and get groceries delivered at their doorstep — similar to Blinkit, but focused on small cities.

> ⚠️ This project was developed in 2024 as a learning and development journey.  
> Active development on this Kotlin version was paused in December 2024.  
> A new version is being rebuilt in React Native (2025).

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I started Grocify in 2024 to:
- Practice native Android development using Kotlin
- Learn Firebase authentication and real-world app flows
- Build an end-to-end app from login to payment
- Understand how e-commerce-like apps function

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Handling permissions, fragments, and deep navigation
- Managing local and remote data sources
- Writing clean architecture with ViewModel and LiveData
- Real-world use of Firebase and third-party SDKs
- Debugging async flows and handling edge cases in UI

## ❄️ Why Development Stopped

In December 2024, I shifted my focus to learning **React Native** and **cross-platform mobile development**.  
While I paused Grocify (Kotlin), the knowledge gained still helps me build better apps today.

## 🔁 What's Next

I’m currently rebuilding **Grocify from scratch in React Native** with modern architecture, UI/UX, and reusable components.  
Stay tuned for the new version soon!
